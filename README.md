Shitty buttplug.io integration with twitch.tv chat

Requires python 3, buttplug-py (pip install buttplug-py), and twitchAPI (pip install twitchAPI) to run, and intface central (https://intiface.com/central/) to actually control a device.

Allows user to set the twitch streamer/chat room and a trigger phrase that when said in chat, will increase a score. A connected device will activate for a set period of time at the level set based on the current score.

This was thrown together quickly and could certainly be refined, but it's at least functional as is. May circle back to make improvements in the future.
